## 2026-05-20 Cycle 1

Plan source: executed `/plan.md` only. The required gate is the paper-matched MindEye2 1-hour baseline on subjects 1/2/5/7 before any ablation.

Code/config changes:
- Replaced `/src/accel.slurm` with a 1-hour Slurm smoke/preflight for the official 1-session fine-tuning config for subject 1: `--use_prior`, `--blurry_recon`, `--hidden_dim=4096`, `--num_sessions=1`, `--batch_size=24`, and `--multisubject_ckpt=../train_logs/final_multisubject_subj01`.
- Added a fast checkpoint existence check so a non-baseline run is not accidentally launched if the required pretrained multisubject checkpoint is absent.
- No changes were made to `Train.py` or `models.py` in this cycle.

Commands/jobs launched:
- `sbatch accel.slurm`
- Slurm job: `8516467` (`c1_baseline_smoke`), requested `1x A100`, `64G`, `01:00:00`.
- Job result: `FAILED`, exit `3:0`, elapsed `00:00:01`.
- Logs: `/src/slurms/c1_baseline_smoke_8516467.out` and `/src/slurms/c1_baseline_smoke_8516467.err`.

Observed setup/results:
- The smoke job failed at preflight because `/scratch/gpfs/KNORMAN/aw1907/MindEyeV2/train_logs/final_multisubject_subj01/last.pth` is missing.
- No baseline training or evaluation metrics were produced, so the baseline gate has not passed.
- No ablations were run, per plan.
- Local required subject beta files exist with voxel counts:
  - subj01: `15724`
  - subj02: `14278`
  - subj05: `13039`
  - subj07: `12682`
- ROI masks are present in `/src/brain_region_masks.hdf5`:
  - subj01: early `4657`, higher `11067`
  - subj02: early `3757`, higher `10521`
  - subj05: early `3661`, higher `9378`
  - subj07: early `3251`, higher `9431`
- Local files include NSD beta/image data and low-level/model support files, but not the required `train_logs/final_multisubject_subj0#` checkpoint folders. The original MindEyeV2 README says these pretrained models are in the HuggingFace dataset `pscotti/mindeyev2` under `train_logs`.

Conclusions:
- Baseline reproduction is blocked by missing paper-required multisubject checkpoints. Training from scratch or using the local `/src/gnet_multisubject.pt` would not be paper-matched: that file is a GNet-style dictionary with keys such as `best_params`, `final_params`, and ROI metadata, not a MindEye2 `last.pth` checkpoint compatible with `Train.py`.
- The next valid step is to stage/download `train_logs/final_multisubject_subj01`, `subj02`, `subj05`, and `subj07` before launching any long baseline training. Once present, rerun the 1-hour smoke for subj01, then launch the full 150-epoch 1-session baseline per subject only after the smoke succeeds.

Recommended next research questions:
- Can the four required pretrained checkpoint folders be staged from HuggingFace without exceeding storage limits?
- After the checkpoint issue is fixed, does the local evaluator reproduce the paper's 1-hour row within tolerance on subj01 before scaling to 1/2/5/7?
- Are refined reconstruction artifacts and the final evaluation notebooks/scripts present for full PixCorr/SSIM/AlexNet/Inception/CLIP/EfficientNet/SwAV/retrieval reporting?

Telegram-ready update:
Cycle 1 established the paper-matched baseline gate but did not produce metrics because the required MindEye2 multisubject checkpoint is missing locally. I replaced `/src/accel.slurm` with a 1-hour paper-config smoke/preflight and submitted job `8516467`; it failed fast in 1 second with missing `/train_logs/final_multisubject_subj01/last.pth`. Data files and ROI masks are present for subjects 1/2/5/7, with voxel counts 15724/14278/13039/12682. No ablations were run. Next action is to stage the official `final_multisubject_subj0#` checkpoint folders from HuggingFace, then rerun the subj01 smoke before full 1-hour baseline jobs.
